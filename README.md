# unraid-plugin

A plugin for running Games on Whales on Unraid

## Important Note

This should be considered early alpha at best.  It is _strongly_ recommended
that you do not attempt to install it on your Unraid server just yet. Testing
is still ongoing and there may still be issues with it; possibly even issues
that we don't know how to help you fix.

## Installation

The plugin is not published yet, you'll have to install it manually. Open a terminal and clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/games-on-whales/unraid-plugin
```

Then head over the `PLUGINS` page on Unraid, `Install Plugin` tab, paste:
```
/root/unraid-plugin/gow.plg
```
and press `INSTALL`

```
