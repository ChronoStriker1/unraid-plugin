# unraid-plugin

A plugin for running Games on Whales on Unraid

## Important Note

This plugin is still a work in progress.  While several people have found it
useful, it is still at least theoretically possible it could be issues with it;
possibly even issues that we don't know how to help you fix.  Having said that,
it doesn't do anything permanent to your system, so uninstalling the plugin
should be a good last-resort solution.

## Installation

Head over the `PLUGINS` page on Unraid, `Install Plugin` tab, paste:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/games-on-whales/unraid-plugin/main/gow.plg
```
and press `INSTALL`

```
